Dear [],

I will not sign your non-compete clause as... 

California’s Labor Code, Section 2870 reads:
```
a) Any provision in an employment agreement which provides

that an employee shall assign, or offer to assign, any of his or her

rights in an invention to his or her employer shall not apply to an

invention that the employee developed entirely on his or her own time

without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or

trade secret information except for those inventions that either:

    Relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer; or
    Result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.

b) To the extent a provision in an employment agreement purports

to require an employee to assign an invention otherwise excluded from

being required to be assigned under subdivision (a), the provision

is against the public policy of this state and is unenforceable.
